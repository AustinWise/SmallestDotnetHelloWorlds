# Smallest Dotnet Hello Worlds

This repo contains several implementations of "Hello World" for different .NET platforms. The
purpose this exercise is to see how th binary size differs. I wrote up my findings in [a blog post](https://www.awise.us/2021/06/05/smallest-dotnet.html).

All experiments are done on Windows x64. For .NET 6, the reletive sizes are in
about the same ballpark for Linux and macOS.

For the non .NET Framework versions, the output is generated by running `dotnet publish -c release`.

## Sizes

## Windows Forms Sizes

While not strictly Hello World, here are the sizes of some GUI programs that
display a single empty form.

As of .NET 7, trimming a Windows Forms project is
[not officially supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trim-self-contained#components-that-cause-trimming-problems).
[Andrii Kurdiumov](https://github.com/kant2002) has contributed fixes to make
to more features of Windows Forms compatable with NativeAOT ( [example](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4971) )
and has a [nuget package](https://github.com/kant2002/WinFormsComInterop) that fixes more issues.
Work is [ongoing](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/4649) to add make
WinForms fully compatible with NativeAOT.

|Folder|Target Framework|Size (KB)|
|--|--|--|
| [11. Windows Forms](11.WindowsFormsNetFramework) | .NET Framework 4.7.2 | 6.5 |
| [12. `dotnet new winforms` Self Contained](12.WindowsFormsSelfContained) | .NET SDK 7.0.102 | 160,681 |
| [14. `dotnet new winforms` AOT](14.WindowsFormsAot) | .NET SDK 7.0.102 NativeAOT | 30,086 |

Note that all these `dotnet new winforms` examples include some
[files related to WPF](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3723)
as well. If your interested in how you can exclude extra files during
publishing, see my [IlLinkerExample repo](https://github.com/AustinWise/IlLinkerExample).

## Comparison to other languages and frameworks
